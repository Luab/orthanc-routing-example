# Orthanc DICOM Routing with AI Integration

A demo project showcasing DICOM study routing between Orthanc servers, with automatic forwarding to an AI inference server when studies stabilize.

## Terms
Orthanc Routing Server: The Orthanc server that routes studies to the AI server. Used to serve images to ODELIA viewer.
Orthanc AI Server: The Orthanc server that performs the AI inference. i.e. processes the images into format suitable for AI models and wraps AI results in DICOM SR/SC format. 
ODELIA Viewer: The viewer application that allows you to send studies to the AI server and view the results.
## Quick Test Guide
### 0. Clone and start containers
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luab/orthanc-routing-example
cd orthanc-routing-example
docker-compose up --build
```
### 1. Upload Studies to Routing Server

Use the Orthanc Explorer web interface at http://localhost:8000/app/explorer.html#upload to upload DICOM studies.

### Viewer Panel Integration

The ODELIA viewer includes a dedicated panel for AI integration that allows you to:
1. Send studies for AI processing
2. View AI results directly in the viewer interface
